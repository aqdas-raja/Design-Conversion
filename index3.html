            <h1>COVID-19</h1>
            <p>
              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              a new virus.
            </p>
            <p>
              The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with
              symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases,
              difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your
              hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close
              contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
            </p>

            <h4>How it spreads</h4>
            <p>
              Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an
              infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a
              person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then
              touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
